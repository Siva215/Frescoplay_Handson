    - The samples represent the life satisfaction score (computed through a methodology) of older adults and younger adults respectively.
    - Hint: Use the ttest_ind function available in scipy.

    Parameters
    ----------

        sample values of age taken from the group1
    sample2 - list
        sample values of age taken from the group2
    
    Returns
    -------
    t_score : float
        t-score of t-test 
    p_value: float
        p-value of t-test 
    """
    return t_score, p_value
