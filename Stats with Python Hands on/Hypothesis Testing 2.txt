    """
    
    - The samples represent the number of chocolate chips consumed by 10 rats. `sample1` represents consumption with stimulation, and `sample2` without simulation.
    - Hint: Use the ttest_rel function available in scipy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1 - list
        sample represents chocolate chips consumption with stimulation
    sample2 - list
        sample represents chocolate chips consumption without stimulation
    
    Returns
    -------
    t_score : float
        t-score of t-test 
    p_value: float
        p-value of t-test 
    """
    return t_score, p_value
